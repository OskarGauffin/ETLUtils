Author: Jan Wijffels
Description: Provides functions to facilitate the use of the ff package in
    interaction with bigdata in SQL databases (e.g. in
    Oracle/MySQL/PostgreSQL/Hive) by allowing easy importing directly into ffdf
    objects using DBI, RODBC and RJDBC. Also contains some basic utility
    functions to do fast left outer join merging based on match and basic
    recoding.
